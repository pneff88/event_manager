# event_manager
In this project I will be accomplishing the following:

read content from a CSV (Comma Separated Value) file
transform it into a standardized format
utilize the data to contact a remote service
populate a template with user data

What we are doing in this tutorial: 
Imagine that a friend of yours runs a non-profit organization around political activism. A number of people have registered for an upcoming event. She has asked for your help in engaging these future attendees. For the first task, she wants you to find the government representatives for each attendee based on their zip code.
